INTRODUCTION
-------------------------------------------

Hi There,

this is the first release of Wintape, a program that
I was as surprised to find myself writing as you
probably are to find it has been written :)

Why Bother?

Well, you see I had these tapes in the attic...

The tapes I retrieved were terrible, signal to noise was
very poor and there were nasty spikes in the data caused
by some unknown interference on whatever 1982 cassette
recorder I was using when 11.

I found Steve McDonalds ZXC/D coders on the web and reverse engineered the ZX81
tape format (mostly, I'd still like to know the full story).
Adding in the filter improved the reliability considerably
however there were several areas where tape dropout had
really got the upper hand. Hence a move to windows and
the chance to move through the listing looking for errors
crossreferenced with the audio samples.


Wintape is a program for converting .raw audio files 
into .P files which can be used in the Xtender series
of emulators (and others). The .raw file is
recorded from a tape of your ZX81 masterpeice
played into the input of your Soundblaster card and
sampled in programs like Wave for Windows or SoundForge.


--------------------------------------------------
SAMPLING THE TAPE
--------------------------------------------------

Record the tape in your favourite sampler at 22050Hz
8-bits, try to get maximum signal to noise and match
the dynamic range to the input of the soundblaster card,
make certain no clipping occurs during recording.

Remove most of the leader (except for a hundred samples or so)
and any trailing noise at the end.

DC restore the data

Normalise the data to the highest peak in the data

Save it in .RAW format! 

--------------------------------------------------
READING THE WAV FILE
--------------------------------------------------

Boot up Wintape, load in the RAW file and click on
READ TAPE, after several seconds (or more...) you
hopefully should get a listing of the ZX81 program
in the left hand window and a load of gibberish in
the right hand window.

HINT: the bytes counter should say something approaching
 the length of the program and the system variables
should look vaguely sensible, usually I found that
STKBOT = STKEND but whether this is always the case
I don't know.


--------------------------------------------------
WRITING THE P FILE
--------------------------------------------------

If all has gone well, the listing and variables look
good, just click on SAVE P-FILE and that's it.



--------------------------------------------------
PROBLEMS
--------------------------------------------------
Well, if no listing appeared there could be several...

1.
Make sure the recording is good, ie: if you look at
it can you work out yourself if there's 1s and 0s
(long and short bits). If you can't really tell then
try recording again or give up and put the tape back
into storage. The only things I know of which may possibly
save such a tape is a two stage convolution filter, 
a wavelet transform or a matched filter... and 
implementing them pushes nostalgia too far.

2.
The ERRORS value shows places where Wintape had to
fix an error in the file, you may still have a large
number even though you can save a valid P-FILE.
The number is useful for reducing errors prior
to hand editing:

The CYCLES value shows the number of individual
wave cycles found in the data, a cycle is defined
as the low-high transition at the threshold point 
set by TRIG-THRESH.

If the silent parts of the signal are pretty clean
you should be able to get a valid listing by experimenting
with the tape reader controls:

The reader works by looking for 1s and 0s based on
different numbers of wave cycles. Usually I found 
4 cycles for a 0 and 9 cycles for a 1 but don't quote
me on it. It recognises a silent break between bits
by waiting until CYCLE-THRESH samples have lapsed
with no wave cycles.


Try tweaking the CYCLE-THRESH value

Try the filter - its a very rough and ready solution
which removes cycles which have no neighbours within
SPIKE FILTER  sample points.

Try rectifying the data (you will have to alter the
number of ONE-CYCLES and ZERO-CYCLES)

Try inverting the data (on some of my tapes the
dropouts were all negative)

3.
If nothing else works then you'll have to resort 
to hand editing the RAW file to retrieve the program.
Wintape can help in this:

With the RAW file loaded and read use the right hand
window (showing the individual bytes found on the
tape) to step through the recording. The lower
window shows the bits that were found to make up
the current byte. Spotting errors is usually pretty
easy.

When you find an error the sample point is shown
in the top left corner with the byte number and value
you can select this number text and cut and paste
it into the GOTO box on your sampling program
to go straight to the correct edit point (plus
or minus a few hundred samples)

Usually increasing or decreasing the volume
is all that's required to get rid of dropouts,
in some cases you have to cut and paste individual
bits from one point in the file to the other, but
then you're supposed to be enjoying this...

Keep clicking on READ TAPE to update the listing,
sometimes it just magically falls into place.

ANOTHER HINT:
The filename and system variable parts (112 bytes +) at the
start of the program need to be perfect for you to 
get a sensible listing, you can be pretty certain
that they're right when the first line of the
program looks okay in the left hand window and
the system variables values aren't outrageous.

--------------------------------------------------
FINALLY
--------------------------------------------------
Thanks for downloading the program, the first
I've written in VB and also the first I've put
out on the web.

The VALLEY is an old proggy written by my brother,
for those who are interested the direction keys
surround the W (ie 1 is move up and left)
The fighting keys are L,B,H for legs,body and head
(you can parry blows as well)
Spells can be cast using S followed by 1,2 or 3


==================================================
This program is Freeware, yer can av it mate, and
if anyone is interested in the source then by
all means drop me an email. No probs.

Known Problems:
The code isn't the greatest, it loads in the whole
wave file at once, uses tons of memory and some
of the algorithms need speeding up, but then
doesn't everything...
